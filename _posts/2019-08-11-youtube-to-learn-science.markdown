Recently, I found that YouTube was an excellent resource to learn new things. As MOOCs emerged as a platform for education, YouTube is also gaining popularity as a place to learn many things which are traditionally taught in the school. A well-designed movie gives us a chance to understand the complicated notion of intuitively. When I was in school, I often illustrate the triangle and circle to grasp the relationship between the theorem and the actual instances described in my notebook.

In this article, I'll show you some YouTube channels, which are pretty interesting to me. They gave me the basic concept of how each idea works so that I could look for more resources about more advanced topics to make my knowledge deeper. YouTube is free, as you know. You can get in touch with the various kinds of resources to learn mathematical notion or scientific theory without paying money at all. I never feel the importance of the internet as much as this time. It is impossible not to make use of the benefit by accessing this knowledge which for sure to move you forward step by step.

# [Primer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKzJFdi57J53Vr_BkTfN3uQ/featured)

First one is **[Primer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKzJFdi57J53Vr_BkTfN3uQ/featured)**. This channel keeps providing the result of mathematical simulation by illustrating fancy human-like characters. The drawing is so plain that we can easily understand how it goes at a glance. I also found the simulation is important to understand the theory works practically.

This video is demonstrating the simulation of how supply and demand mechanics in economics work under a simple assumption. Explanation without mathematical equation is another characteristic of Primer videos. Thus it would be possible to make the video simple.

**[3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw)** is a channel for a little more advanced listeners. Although it entirely makes use of the illustrations and drawings, it also contains some mathematical equations. It may seem to be a bit challenging to understand the video. But I never see the explanation as clear as 3Blue1Brown is.

To implement [FFT and related ops in TensorFlow.js](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-core/commit/ebcb59853e23eab4dbe031b9e517752384c05dae), I have watched the video many times to grasp how FFT is executed thoroughly. It is beneficial to implement the algorithm with mathematical understanding.

# [Khan Academy](https://www.youtube.com/user/khanacademy)

Needless to say the popularity of Khan Academy, there are so many videos to learn mathematical things formally. While there is [an official site](https://www.khanacademy.org/) to host everything about Khan Academy, YouTube channel may be able to give you more accessibility to the video.

# [WSJ Glossary](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK7tptUDHh-RYDsdxO1-5QQ)

Last but not least, Wall Street Jornal has an exciting video series, WSJ Glossary. WSJ publishes many videos about economic analysis and news. At the same time, it sometimes creates videos to learn the basic terminology and notion about economics, which is related to the real story.

This video explains how VIX illustrate the volatility of options or assets. Even people who may not be familiar with the investment can get start their learning with this video. When the market is turmoil, you may want to know why it happens, and people are anxious about it. There is no location which is collecting all videos in the series. Please take the time to look for the videos of WSJ Glossary.

# Recap

Of course, there are many excellent resources to learn scientific things on YouTube. This list is the only part of it. And I cannot keep in touch with all subscriptions. Around 3~4 channels are the nice number of keep track of them. Please let me know if you find any other exciting channels to subscribe to YouTube.

Thanks!
