As well as last year, I gave a presentation at DB Tech Showcase Tokyo 2017.

I talked about the connector detail of Presto. We found there were several points to be considered when implementing our custom connector on cloud storage like S3.

DB Tech Showcase is a conference where I can do interact with some DB administrator I do not meet each other usually.
And also there were several talks I usually never heard of. Especially, the talk about MongoDB, Groonga and Oracle was interesting to me. Both sessions are basic ones but sufficiently exciting. The content will be uploaded [here](http://www.db-tech-showcase.com/dbts/tokyo).

In the session about Google Cloud Spanner, [this white paper](https://research.google.com/pubs/pub45855.html) was introduced as the background and insight of Spanner. I want to read it when I get a chance.
