As well as last year, I gave a presentation at DB Tech Showcase Tokyo 2017.

I talked about the connector detail of Presto. We found there were several points to be considered when implementing our custom connector on cloud storage like S3.

DB Tech Showcase is a conference where I can do interact with some DB administrator I do not meet each other usually.
