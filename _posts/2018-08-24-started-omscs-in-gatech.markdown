I graduated the university 8 years ago with only bachelor of degree of computer science. While I enjoyed my working career so much with that, 
I started considering getting it forwarded by re-educated in the school. I longed for the degree in the university in the United States. But 
it is difficult for me to study abroad because I need to give up my current job and livings. That's not what I want to do.

OMSCS provides me a chance to get a master of degree in CS field without moving to United States. OMSCS is a course to get a valid degree in US 
which means OMSCS is recognized by [UPCEA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Tech_Online_Master_of_Science_in_Computer_Science).

So I have prepared these 6 month to make an admission to OMSCS course. And finally the Fall 2018 term has just started. I'm very looking forward to getting
the master of the degree in 2 or 3 years. That must contribute make my career better. Please let me know anytime if you have also entered OMSCS course.

Thanks.
