This blog was kept for 4 years. Of course there are some times when I stop writing.
But anyway updating blog posts itself are kept for 4 years. I'm now considering keep blogging is difficult and tough work. But I found an practical article for keep blogging. This post describes the motivation and mentality for keep blogging.

I totally agree with him. I thought there is no one who cares what I wrote even I kept writing 4 years. So I don't have any fear to publishing contents. I posted not only useful posts (I thought at least!) but also wasted, rubbish contents. Anyway no one cares. I received responses rarely. No access growing, no criticism. So please don't care what you are writing if you want to keep blogging. No one cares.

# Just Practice

As the author of [this article](https://dev.to/yelluw/want-to-blog-read-this), English is my second language. So there are a lot of grammatical mistakes in my blog. The reason why I'm writing my blog in English is practice. Writing a lot of Engligh documents can contribute my English skill improvement. I'm not sure I could improve my English writing, but I can write articles in English without any mental barrier in short time. That might be the one I obtained after writing in English.

So what I want to write here is don't care what you are writing!
