[Twitter seems to have moved their infrastructure to NodeJS from Scala](https://twitter.com/necolas/status/829128165314306048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.utali.io%2Fentry%2F2017%2F02%2F24%2F170000).

> Today we moved all of Twitter's mobile web traffic (that's like, a lot) to our new web stack â€“ Node.js, Express, React PWA.

I'm wondering they will keep supporting finagle in future...
